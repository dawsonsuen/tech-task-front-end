Hi there, 
    I have completed this SPA fulfilled the three key business requirements:
    
* Display the current temperature in degrees celsius
* Display the temperature based on the geolocation (note; not the IP!) of your browser
* Display a simple icon and label based on the weather information provided (eg. sunny, cloudy, rainy etc).

    Thanks for your time.

Best regards,

Dawson Sun
